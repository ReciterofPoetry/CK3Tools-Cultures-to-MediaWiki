Place this application in the root folder of the total conversion mod and it will parse the cultures into a text file containing a MediaWiki formatted table. There is special code for Godherja's culture descriptions.

WINDOWS ONLY release. If you want to use it on Mac or Linux, you can download the source code and compile it with Visual Studio for that purpose. I make no guarantees for it working.

This is intended to work with all mods but has only been tested on Godherja and the base game. If it does not work, please let me know on the [CK3 Mod Co-op Discord server](https://discord.gg/BPECFtjaF2). I will be the dude with `CK3Tools` in his server nickname.
